So This is a kind of readme file and here i wanna write for my own understanding the flow of the application.
                                              
                                              1.First Step.
Store(creation of store at first): we have a folder called store in which i have stored the whole logic for store in react-redux. In store i have a main file which is Index.jsx and slices , we all know slices are individual logic which is used to define certain functionality. Using configureStore({reducer: {}}) i have created a store and also stored the reducer. Our redux toolkit automatically creates a productReducer and cartReducer just give them a key and make them equal to that value.
Yeah one more thing how slices are created we use createSlice(()) method which contains parameters like name:, initialState:, reducers:, export const {fetchCartItemsError} = cartSlice.actions; and export all of the actions which we have defined inside the reducers and at last do this to export the reducer export default cartSlice.reducer;
                                              
                                              2.Second Step.
Now lets move towards the componets part although i have many files cluttered inside it let's do our best to understand it, first let's see each component and their use first of all we have 
    --><Header/> which is the header part of my website which should be rendered at all times in that i have the logic of what should be rendered at the head of our application which is the name of the application and the logo also the number of items in our cart as well as the logic of useEffect(()=>) with fetch which runs as soon as our application starts running.

    --><Home/> Now this one is interesting as i have used react-router-dom in my application to ensure smooth and easy navigation between the pages in my application what happens is const router = createBrowserRouter([{path: '/',element: <App />,children: [{path: '/',element: <Home />,},{path: '/cart',element: <Cart />,},],},]) this is my router logic in my Main.jsx what happens here is my <App/> component is the parent component which is being rendered at first when the path is '/' and as we know we have nothing inside the App component except the <Header/> and <Outlet/> component now i have already explained what is the use of header let's see about Outlet , Outlet component is used in react-router-dom which is a inbuilt property of it is used to render the child component of the parent so in my router logic it says if the path is '/' then render App but as there is <Outlet/> in it also render the <Home/> component.Outside the Outlet component whatever that is , is always being shown in the screen as the parent router is App and that's why in all of the application we would see the <Header/> component being rendered.<Home/> component shows the image, price, name of the product that we got from api call which is inside the <Header/> component.

    --><product/> this is being rendered from inside the home component as it shows the rating , price , add to cart button on the screen Nothing special.

    --><Cart/> this one is also interesting as we can already tell by it's name that is the component which is responsible for out cart and contains all the logic related to how cart is being shown on the screen
